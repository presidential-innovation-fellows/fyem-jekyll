description:
  Trying to learn how to be self-sufficient without a strong support system or opportunities to develop practical life skills.
drivers:
  - Survival, basic needs, making the “right” decision, wanting to feel valued and respected
feelings:
  - I may not know how to form a healthy relationship. What does my network look like now? I’m more than just a foster kid… what’s my identity?

youth_agency_opportunities:
  - Connect young people to foster youth alumni networks, potentially to older foster youth mentors.
  - Provide young people with resources for them to connect with when they have questions, if they feel unsafe etc. Since the agency is their network, give them dedicated people who they can use as resources when they need them.
