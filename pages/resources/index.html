By engaging successful parent alumna of the child welfare system, agencies can provide current involved families with empathetic partners, and build community ties.

            <h3>Self Care and Lifestyle Balance Inventory</h3>
            <p>
              Social worker burnout in child welfare agencies remains a huge challenge for worker wellbeing within child welfare agencies, and a significant obstacle to permanency for foster children and youth. Studies have shown that rates of permanency drop significantly each time a case changes hands between social workers. By using this assessment, you can get an idea of where your agency stands on worker wellbeing, and areas for improvement.
