      Foster care is supposed to be a temporary safe haven for young people who have experienced abuse and neglect, but it’s not always so. Compliance and regulations are often prioritized over wellbeing, and families commonly feel stigmatized instead of supported. We worked with foster care alumni and staff at the Child & Family Services Agency to map out what it’s like to go through the system as a young person. Together, we identified universal touch points in the system and included opportunities to support and strengthen families, and help youth develop skills.
