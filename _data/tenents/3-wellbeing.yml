  No standardized definition of wellbeing exists for child welfare, so we asked
  youth and families to define it themselves-- wellbeing for a youth is when
  he/she/they are thriving emotionally, physically, financially, and
  educationally rather than “just surviving.” The Wellbeing Indicator Tool for
  Youth (WIT-Y) is a tool that quantifies it.
