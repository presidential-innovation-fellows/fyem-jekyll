  Currently, no standardized definition of wellbeing exists for child welfare,
  so we asked youth and families to define it themselves-- wellbeing for a youth
  is when he/she/they are thriving emotionally, physically, financially, and
  educationally rather than “just surviving.” This means that basic needs and
  psychological needs are all met. The Wellbeing Indicator Tool for Youth is one
  way that youth ages 15 - 21 can provide a qualitative self-assessment of their
  wellbeing and set goals to increase it.
