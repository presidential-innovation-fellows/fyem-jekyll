title: Child Welfare Terms
definitions:
  Agency: The capacity, condition, or state of acting or of exerting power.
  Permanency: The youth has been safely reunified with family who are continuing to receive support or adopted by kinship guardians or foster parents who are continuing to receive support.
  Safety: The youth is not exposed to or experiencing abuse and/or neglect in any form by adults or peers.
  Wellbeing: Currently, no standardized definition of wellbeing exists in the child welfare practice, so we asked youth and families to define it themselves-- The youth is thriving emotionally, physically, financially, and educationally rather than “just surviving.” This means that basic needs and psychological needs are all met. The Wellbeing Indicator Tool for Youth is one way that youth ages 15 - 21 can self-assess their wellbeing.
